# DataDefender

## Inspiration
The inspiration for DataDefender came from the growing concern around online privacy and security. We noticed that as more people rely on the internet for their daily activities, there was a lack of tools that could help them evaluate the safety and privacy of the websites they visit. We wanted to create a solution that could empower internet users to take control of their online privacy and security.

We believe that everyone deserves to feel safe and secure while navigating the digital world. With the rise of cyber threats such as hacking and data breaches, it's more important than ever to have a tool that can help users make informed decisions about their online activities. We saw an opportunity to make a difference in this space and developed DataDefender to provide users with a comprehensive analysis of the security and ethical standards of every website they visit. Our goal is to help people feel confident in their online activities, knowing that they are protected from cyber threats and that their privacy is being respected.

## What it does
DataDefender is a chrome extension that provides users with a comprehensive analysis of the security and ethical standards of every website they visit. It generates a security score and cyber ethics analysis for each website, giving users an understanding of the risks associated with their online activities.

In addition to analyzing the security and ethical standards of websites, DataDefender also provides alternative options for websites with subpar privacy policies. This enables users to make informed decisions about the websites they visit, ensuring that their online activities align with their privacy and ethical standards.

By providing users with the information they need to make informed decisions, DataDefender empowers users to take control of their online privacy and security. The extension is designed to help users navigate the digital world with greater confidence, knowing that they are protected from cyber threats and that their privacy is being respected.

## How we built it
At DataDefender, we built the project using a combination of JavaScript and HTML. We wanted to create a user-friendly and intuitive experience for our users, which is why we chose to build a chrome extension. Our team worked tirelessly to ensure that the extension would seamlessly integrate into users' browsing experience, providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about their online activities.

To generate the analysis for each website, we utilized the powerful OpenAI GPT-3 model. We were impressed with the model's ability to analyze websites' security protocols, privacy policies, and ethical standards, giving our users a comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with their online activities. Additionally, we used a third-party API to gather data on each website's privacy policies and data collection practices. This allowed us to provide users with alternative options for websites with subpar privacy policies, further empowering them to take control of their online privacy and security.

We are proud of the hard work and dedication that went into creating DataDefender. Our team was committed to creating a tool that could make a meaningful difference in the lives of internet users. By utilizing cutting-edge technologies and a user-centered approach, we believe that DataDefender has the potential to transform the way people think about online privacy and security.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing DataDefender was an exciting challenge for us, but it was not without its obstacles. One of the most significant challenges we faced was integrating the GPT-3 model into our project. As a team, we had limited time, and we were working virtually, with some of us juggling school commitments. Despite these limitations, we remained committed to our goal of creating a comprehensive tool that could help users evaluate the safety and privacy of the websites they visit.

To integrate the GPT-3 model, we had to spend a considerable amount of time fine-tuning the model and making sure that the analysis it generated was accurate and relevant. We wanted to ensure that users received the most up-to-date information on website security and ethical standards. Additionally, we had to work through some technical issues with the API we used to gather data on websites. It was a complex process that required careful attention to detail, but our team was able to work through these challenges and create a tool that we are proud of. Despite the obstacles we faced, we remain committed to our goal of helping people navigate the digital world safely and securely.
